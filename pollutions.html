      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Environmental pollution has become one of the greatest problems of the current period and this can lead to the
        damage of the planet with all lives on it. It's not good for the air, water, soil, and even the plastic we throw
        away. Pollution can make people and animals sick. We need to know where it comes from, how it harms us, and how
        to fix it. This is important to keep our Earth safe for the future.</p>

      <h1 class="sub_title">Air Pollution</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Air pollution means bad stuff in the air, caused by things we do like driving cars, making things in factories, and farming. This includes tiny bits in the air, stuff from cars and factories that can make the air dirty, and gases that warm the planet. It's not just bad for people, giving us breathing problems, heart issues, and making us die sooner, but it also hurts the Earth. It can lead to foggy air, acid rain, and harm the layer high up that keeps us safe from the sun, which affects animals, plants, and how we grow food.</p>

      <h1 class="sub_title">Water Pollution</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Water gets dirty when harmful stuff gets into rivers, lakes, seas, and under the ground, making it bad and unsafe to use. Dirty water comes from places like factories, city waste water, farm runoff, oil leaks, and trash not thrown away right. Bad things like poison, heavy bits, germs, and tiny plastic bits can harm water life, peopleâ€™s health, and the balance of nature. This makes living places for water creatures bad, kills many types of life, and spreads sicknesses from water, making it hard to get clean water for drinking, cleaning, and fun times outside.</p>

      <h1 class="sub_title">Plastic Pollution</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Plastic trash piles up in our world, including seas, rivers, beaches, and on land. This happens when we don't dispose of plastic right, don't recycle enough, and use too much throw-away plastic. Plastic waste harms sea life, animals, and lands, as creatures eat or get caught in plastic stuff, causing hurt, lack of air, and death. Also, tiny plastic bits can get into what we eat, which may harm our health.</p>
